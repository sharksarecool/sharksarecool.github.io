                                 <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My goal is to make sure everyone admits that they love sharks. To do so, I would send out websites for everyone to see. These website include things about sharks, ifunny, anime, watching anime sites, and of coarse: MORE SHARKS!</p>
                                 <h2> If you hate sharks, you should probably get out of this website turn around 3 times and re-think about what sites you want to go to.</h2>
                                 <p>First, I want to start with <a href="agar.io">Agario.</a></p>
