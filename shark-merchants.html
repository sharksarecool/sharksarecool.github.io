    <h1>Shark Merchants</h1>
    <h2>Sharks are the best!</h2>
    <p>This is a shop that you can buy plushes and more! However, this is a warning! You can't actually buy anything so if you came here to shop, sorry. But don't be bummed! at least you can look at all the pictures of all the things in the store. Just please don't expect me to make it so you can buy things. I don't know much about website coding. By the way, web coding is harder than you think!</p>
